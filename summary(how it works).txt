Overall summary that how firewall filters traffic

Think of a firewall like a security guard for your network. Every time a data “visitor” (packet) wants to come in or go out, the guard checks:

1.Who it is – Where is it coming from and where is it going?
2.What it wants – Which door (port) or type of communication it’s trying to use.
3.The rulebook – Does it match the allowed list or the blocked list?

Then the firewall decides:

Let it in if it’s safe.
Stop it if it’s suspicious or not allowed.
Make a note for monitoring or later review.

Some firewalls are simple and check packets one by one (like a quick ID check), while others are smarter and remember past visitors, letting only those who have a valid “ticket” continue.

In short: a firewall keeps your network safe by deciding who can come in or go out.
